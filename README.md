# UDACITY MULTI-USER BLOG

Hello! Welcome to this blog. The last bastion of free speech on the internet.
You want a website that isn't moderated? 
Try this one out! 
Just kidding, don't fuck this website up. I mean speak your mind but don't be a dick.

If you want to just see what this website can do, go to http://polar-caldron-147103.appspot.com/

If you want to build it yourself and modify it in some way, download the zip or clone the repository to your desktop.

To run, make sure you have the Google App Engine tools installed.
Then, all you have to do is type

dev_appserver.py .

And you should be up and running! Go to localhost:8080 to see the glory.

If you run into any errors, try googling them. If that doesn't work, send them to me.
How? I'm not really sure. Open up an issue ticket?
